<h4>A simple WebSocket application, created using Java API for WebSocket.</h4>

This app can be used as an example if you need to create and deploy a websocket.
More about WebSocket API : https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/websocket.htm


<h4>Environment:</h4>
- Java 8
- Maven 3.0.5
- Tomcat 8.0.30

To run this app, you need to package it into war archive
and deploy to the server. I use Maven plugin to deploy
app to my Tomcat (reference to it can be found in pom.xml).
In order to use it, some minor configurations should be done
with Tomcat and Maven. Details here :

When the application is deployed it can be accessed from your favourite browser.
For my Tomcat the URL is http://localhost:8080/websocket-demo/ .
